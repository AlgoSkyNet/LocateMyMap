# LocateMyMap
The prime objective of “LocateMyMap” Android application is to locate a list of nearby places just like ATM, bank, hospital, restaurants etc. based on the current location and distance between them with navigation & locate a friend through SMS or to inform our location to him/her.
There are times, when people like to know the current location of his/her friends or colleagues, apart from staying in touch, which we do in social networking applications. More often we just want to share our exact location with someone. And in our daily life we visit places like ATM, Bank, Restaurant etc. So if we are new to a place then how to find these? So, taking these thoughts into consideration, we are planning to develop an application which will behave as follows.
This application will provide user with his/her friends location using GPS (Global Positioning System). It will provide global position of that device itself the user is holding, and through satellite by just sending a SMS.
And it will also give us the location of places we used to visit like ATM, Banks, Hospitals, Restaurants etc. in our radius of distance. And it will also provide the path to the location with navigation. By which we can measures the distance, time taken on walk or via vehicle between place and us. We can also share these place locations and details through social networking app like Whatsapp, Facebook.
